I currently reside in New York City where I am pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at Columbia University while working as a Data Scientist at Major League Baseball. I find creative ways to solve quantitative problems, answer questions, and build products
with my wide-range of experience and education in Operations Research and Computer Science.

While I enjoy applying my skills to create new metrics and improve the fan experience from new-age baseball tracking data, my interests also span other applications. Specifically, I love learning what drives people to make decisions and exploring data and techniques to discover these latent factors. I have become increasingly interested in uncovering how natural language and multimedia approaches can help us enrich our understanding of peoplesâ€™ actions, opinions, and connections. I am always excited to investigate how to predict and forecast outcomes in the future and optimize decision making in areas such as consumer interaction and understanding, business, medical research, and sports.

Given my creativity and strong desire to see an impact, I strive to work at the intersection of research and implementation.
