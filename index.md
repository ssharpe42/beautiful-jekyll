I currently reside in New York City where I am pursuing a Masters in 
Computer Science at Columbia University while working as a Data Scientist at Major League Baseball. 
I love finding creative ways to solve quantitative problems, answer questions, and build products
with my wide-range of experience and education in Operations Research and Computer Science. 

While I love applying my skills to create new metrics and improve the fan experience from 
new age baseball tracking data, my interests span other applications. Specifically, I am always excited to
investigate how to optimize decision making under stochastic conditions. I love learning what drives people to make decisions, 
whether it's underlying latent factors or specific patterns in their actions. 
I have become increasingly interested uncovering how natural language and multimedia 
approaches can help us enrich our understanding of peoples' actions, opinions, and connections.
